# Workspace Template

This directory mirrors the sanitized assets that normally live under `workspace/` in the project root. Clone this repo, copy the relevant template into your own `workspace/`, and then populate `workspace-local/` with your private data.

Available templates:
- `allowlist/` – Sample allowlist + hash JSON files.
- `cloudfront/` – Skeleton CloudFront distribution config.
- `harrisonfamily-frontend/` – Placeholder README describing ETL output expectations.
- `etl-output/` – Placeholder README for synthetic Gramps exports.
